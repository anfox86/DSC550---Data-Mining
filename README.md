## Predicting Survival on the Titanic
Trying to take my datasource and predict whether a passenger survived.

### Description
This project was a personal favorite as my daughter and I love the story of the Titanic. We have spent many hours discussing what happened, and what we thought could have changed the overall outcome. So for this I tried to predict survival of a passenger on the Titanic. The method on this was to try several different algorithm types to figure out which would score the best. Ultimately Random Forest was selected as it scores the best out of 8 other algorithms.
